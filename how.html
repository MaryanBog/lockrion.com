    <h1>How Lockrion Works</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Lockrion enables issuers to create transparent, time-locked reward programs on Solana.
      All parameters are defined before launch and cannot be modified afterward.
      Execution is handled entirely by deterministic smart contracts.
    </p>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Reward Is Fixed</h2>
      <p>
        When an issuance is created, the total reward reserve is defined in advance and
        permanently locked into the contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the reserve is declared as 100,000 USDC, it remains exactly 100,000 USDC.
        It cannot be increased, reduced, or reallocated after deployment.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Reward Must Be Fully Funded</h2>
      <p>
        Participation becomes possible only after the full reward reserve is funded on-chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no partial funding, no soft launch, and no discretionary adjustments.
        The reserve must exist in full before deposits are accepted.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Participation Is Time-Locked</h2>
      <p>
        Each issuance defines a fixed participation window with a start time and a maturity time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deposits are accepted only during the active window.
        Deposits after maturity are rejected.
        Withdrawals before maturity are not permitted.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Distribution Is Deterministic</h2>
      <p>
        Rewards are calculated and distributed automatically by the smart contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no manual interventions, governance votes, or administrative overrides.
        The outcome is determined solely by predefined rules and on-chain state.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>After Maturity</h2>
      <p>
        Once maturity is reached, participants may claim rewards according to the contract logic.
        Deposits are handled strictly under the defined settlement rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any unclaimed rewards follow predefined on-chain logic.
        No parameters can be altered after deployment.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>No Hidden Control</h2>
      <p>
        After deployment, issuance parameters cannot be modified.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no administrative keys, upgrade paths, or emergency backdoors.
        The contract executes exactly as written.
