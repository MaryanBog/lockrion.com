    <div class="section" id="overview">
      <h2>Protocol Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Lockrion is a commercially governed deployment platform for autonomous, time-locked reserve issuances implemented as immutable smart contracts on Solana.
        Governance exists only prior to deployment. After deployment, execution is controlled exclusively by on-chain logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each issuance is an independent instance with immutable parameters, strict reserve funding requirements, deterministic accounting, and post-maturity settlement.
        Issuances are structurally isolated and do not share escrow accounts or accounting state.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        Lockrion does not provide investment advice, does not guarantee yield, and does not manage participant assets after deployment.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="architecture">
      <h2>Architecture</h2>

      <h3>Layer Separation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="k">Governance Layer (off-chain)</span>: issuer admission, parameter screening, fee determination, and deployment decisions prior to deployment only.</li>
        <li><span class="k">Issuance Layer (on-chain)</span>: immutable execution, accounting, escrow control, and settlement after deployment.</li>
        <li><span class="k">Interface Layer (UI)</span>: non-authoritative interface; users may interact directly with issuance contracts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Issuance Independence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each issuance maintains isolated state and isolated escrow accounts.</li>
        <li>No pooled reserves exist.</li>
        <li>Failure or inefficiency in one issuance does not affect others.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="execution">
      <h2>Execution Model</h2>

      <h3>Immutable Parameters</h3>
      <p>
        Issuance parameters are fixed at deployment and cannot be modified.
        The v1 profile includes fixed reward asset (USDC), fixed reserve_total, fixed start/maturity timestamps, and fixed claim window configuration.
      </p>

      <h3>Reserve Funding Gate</h3>
      <p>
        Participation is disabled until the reward reserve is fully funded on-chain.
        Partial funding is rejected.
        Funding must occur strictly prior to the participation window.
      </p>

      <h3>Time Window Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Deposits are permitted only during the participation window.
        Deposits after maturity are rejected.
        Withdrawals before maturity are prohibited by design.
      </p>

      <h3>Deterministic Accounting</h3>
      <p>
        Accounting and distribution are deterministic, integer-based, and reproducible.
        No floating-point arithmetic is used.
        Overflow/invalid states must fail transactions rather than produce ambiguous outcomes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="escrow">
      <h2>Escrow Model</h2>

      <h3>Deposit Escrow</h3>
      <p>
        Participant deposits are held in a dedicated deposit escrow account (lock asset).
        Deposits remain isolated and are not used for reward funding.
        Deposit release is permitted only by immutable post-maturity withdrawal logic.
      </p>

      <h3>Reward Escrow</h3>
      <p>
        The full USDC reward reserve is held in a dedicated reward escrow account.
        The reserve cannot be increased after deployment.
        Reward funds can move only through predefined claim/sweep/reclaim paths.
      </p>

      <h3>Non-Commingling Guarantee</h3>
      <p>
        Deposit escrow and reward escrow are strictly segregated.
        No commingling is permitted under any circumstances.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="settlement">
      <h2>Settlement</h2>

      <h3>Maturity Transition</h3>
      <p>
        At maturity, participation ends permanently.
        No new deposits are accepted.
        Accounting stops accumulating new participation weight beyond the defined window.
      </p>

      <h3>Claim Phase</h3>
      <p>
        Reward claiming is available within a predefined claim window after maturity.
        Claims are computed deterministically and are bounded strictly by the fixed reserve.
      </p>

      <h3>Deposit Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>
        Deposits remain withdrawable after maturity.
        Withdrawal is not dependent on reward claiming.
      </p>

      <h3>Unclaimed Reward Handling</h3>
      <p>
        Unclaimed rewards follow predefined immutable rules after claim window expiration.
        This handling does not modify historical accounting and does not recalculate results.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="immutability">
      <h2>Immutability</h2>

      <h3>Post-Deployment Finality</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Program upgrade authority is revoked at deployment.</li>
        <li>No administrative keys are retained for changing issuance behavior.</li>
        <li>No pause, emergency override, or discretionary intervention mechanisms exist.</li>
        <li>Parameters and execution logic remain immutable for the lifetime of the issuance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reproducibility</h3>
      <p>
        Outcomes are reproducible from public on-chain data.
        Any observer can verify reserve funding, escrow balances, timestamps, and settlement outcomes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="compliance">
      <h2>Compliance & Risk</h2>

      <h3>Platform Role Limitation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lockrion provides deployment infrastructure and a convenience interface.</li>
        <li>Lockrion does not act as an asset manager, custodian, broker, or investment advisor.</li>
        <li>Lockrion does not guarantee yield, profitability, or economic performance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Participant Risk Allocation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Participants bear market, liquidity, volatility, and opportunity risks of the locked asset.</li>
        <li>Reward outcomes are bounded strictly by the declared reserve and proportional rules.</li>
        <li>Participation is voluntary and governed exclusively by public on-chain rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Issuer Risk Allocation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Issuers bear responsibility for fully funding the reward reserve prior to participation.</li>
        <li>Issuers cannot access participant deposits and cannot modify the issuance after deployment.</li>
        <li>Any reclaim/sweep paths are strictly predefined and are not discretionary.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Compensation Framework</h3>
      <p>
        Lockrion v1 does not implement on-chain compensation mechanisms.
        Compensation, if any, is external, discretionary, and must not modify on-chain accounting, state, or results.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="rct">
      <h2>Reserve Commitment Theory (RCT) Basis</h2>
      <p>
        Lockrion implements Reserve Commitment Theory under a strict implementation profile intended to maximize predictability and eliminate discretionary behavior.
        Issuances are fixed commitments with time-discrete accounting, bounded reserves, proportional deterministic distribution, and structural independence.
      </p>

      <h3>Constitutional Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Commitment</li>
        <li>Reserve Non-Extractability</li>
        <li>Absolute Issuance Immutability</li>
        <li>Temporal Discreteness</li>
        <li>Proportional Distribution</li>
        <li>Issuance Independence</li>
        <li>Reproducibility</li>
        <li>Compensation Boundaries</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lockrion v1 Implementation Profile</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reward asset is fixed to USDC.</li>
        <li>Reward reserve must be fully funded before participation begins.</li>
        <li>Reserve increases are not permitted after deployment.</li>
        <li>Settlement occurs through a post-maturity claim phase with a predefined claim window.</li>
        <li>Arithmetic is deterministic, fixed-width, and integer-based.</li>
        <li>No administrative or governance intervention is possible after deployment.</li>
      </ul>
