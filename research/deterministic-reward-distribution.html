        <p>
          Most on-chain reward systems rely on discretionary allocation, mutable
          emission schedules, or off-chain settlement logic. Lockrion takes a different
          approach.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Lockrion defines a deterministic reserve-backed issuance model on Solana.
          Every issuance begins with a fixed reward reserve that is locked at initialization
          and governed entirely by immutable smart contract logic. From that moment forward,
          distribution becomes a purely on-chain, algebraic process — not a managerial decision.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The maximum distributable amount is known in advance, publicly verifiable,
          and cannot be altered retroactively.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Reserve Commitment</h2>
      
        <p>
          At genesis, the issuer deposits the full reward pool into a program-controlled
          escrow account. No partial funding. No dynamic expansion. No minting after launch.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The reserve is structurally bounded from the first block. Distribution does not
          create value — it only reallocates a predefined amount among participants.
          The system behaves as a closed, mathematically constrained environment.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Time-Locked Participation</h2>
      
        <p>
          Participation is limited to a strictly defined Active window. Deposits are
          accepted only within this interval and remain locked until maturity.
          Intraday timing does not provide advantage.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Instead of rewarding capital velocity, the contract accumulates time-weighted
          participation for each address.
        </p>
      
        <p>The effective weight of a participant is defined as:</p>
      
        <pre style="font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, monospace; font-size: 13px; padding: 10px 12px; border-radius: 10px; background: rgba(2,6,23,0.35); border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.10); overflow:auto;">weight = deposited_amount × lock_duration</pre>
      
        <p>
          This structurally prevents late-stage capital injection from distorting
          proportional distribution. Reward share reflects both the size and the
          duration of commitment — not execution speed.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Deterministic Reward Calculation</h2>
      
        <p>
          After maturity, rewards are computed using a fixed proportional formula:
        </p>
      
        <pre style="font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, monospace; font-size: 13px; padding: 10px 12px; border-radius: 10px; background: rgba(2,6,23,0.35); border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.10); overflow:auto;">user_reward = (user_weight / total_weight) × total_reserve</pre>
      
        <p>
          All variables are stored in program state accounts and are fully verifiable
          on-chain. No oracle inputs. No off-chain reconciliation. No administrative
          adjustment.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The result is deterministic and reproducible for any observer with access
          to blockchain state.
        </p>
      
        <h2>Settlement Architecture</h2>
      
        <p>
          Reward claiming and capital withdrawal are intentionally separated.
          Claiming a reward does not withdraw principal. Withdrawing principal
          does not alter reward state.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Each operation is gated by explicit program rules and executed
          independently, ensuring clarity and minimizing hidden coupling
          between reward and liquidity flows.
        </p>
      
        <h2>On-Chain Guarantees</h2>
      
        <p>
          The issuance contract enforces the following structural constraints:
        </p>
      
        <p>
          — the reward reserve is immutable after initialization<br>
          — participation is bounded by a predefined time window<br>
          — reward entitlement is single-execution<br>
          — principal withdrawal is limited to locked balance<br>
          — settlement logic is fully deterministic and reproducible
        </p>
      
        <h2>What Lockrion Is — and Is Not</h2>
      
        <p>
          Lockrion does not implement trading engines, liquidity pools, pricing
          algorithms, or speculative mechanisms.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          It is a reserve commitment and deterministic distribution framework —
          a minimal financial primitive designed to eliminate discretionary
          allocation and encode reward logic directly into immutable program state.
